# Compilers-Class-Project

This is YACCP (Yet Another Compiler Class Project) a mini compiler built for my compilers class, it uses intermediate representation to translate the received code into Quadruples that will later be compiled and executed by a virtual machine.

For the grammar of the language, please refer to [Lexer_parser.py](Lexer_parser.py).

Main file: [Yaccp.py](Yaccp.py).

To run it, use `py yaccp.py` or `py yaccp.py <filename>`.

The first option will prompt a dialog for you to search for your own file
